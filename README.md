## Other

This was my second time trying out WebSockets to see how they work. Overall they're quite simple to add to use but I haven't looked into the best practices and so have just used it in a way that I thought made sense.

[Vercel doesn't support WebSocket connections](https://vercel.com/support/articles/do-vercel-serverless-functions-support-websocket-connections) - so something else like Heroku should be used for hosting. Alternatively, the WebSocket functionality could be reimplemented with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/channels), but I haven't looked into a good open source option and I'd rather self-host.

Inspired by [Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/).

Seeing as this was an attempt to just try WebSockets, no attempts were made to style this project so it looks ü§Æ
